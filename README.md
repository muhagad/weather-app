# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
you should start the server by typing node server.js in terminal or you might use any webserver of your choice
that will initiate the webpage and start inserting the data required in the field to show your city temperature 
i could not use zip because my city 'Cairo' zip code did not work actually so i used the city url api from getweather api
because when i used my city zip code it retrieve no city found
clicking on generate will add your city temperature and date to the entryholder by creating a data array
